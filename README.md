# No Room to Breathe
A narrative game for Android, developed with Ink integration in Unity, with the intention of bringing the player closer to the experience that a person who is in an abusive relationship goes through.

## Notes
No Room To Breathe was originally conceived by three UFV students as an university work, and the first prototype was finished by May 2018.

No Room To Breathe tells the story of Sella, a young student who has just met Andrés, a lovely boy that makes her feel unique from the first day. The game shows the progression of the relationship from the falling in love until its degradation (progressive jealousy and control, abuse and coercion).

At this moment (May 5th, 2018) there are 6 ink files (in Spanish), each one containing a conversation between Sella (the player) and one of her friends/acquaintances. They are well integrated in the basic interface that is programmed for now. Only 9:16 aspect ratio is supported.
